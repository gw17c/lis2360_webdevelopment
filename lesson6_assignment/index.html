            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The internet of things movement is evolving the world of technology today. The internet of things is a new model of communication that conceptualizes a future where everyday objects will be assembled with digital communication transceivers, microcontrollers, and suitable protocol stacks. These devices will allow these objects to communicate with each other and the consumer. This movement will evolve into an essential component of the Internet (Zanella, Bui, Castellani, Vangelista, & Zorzi, 2014). In other words, this advanced technology allows appliances, vehicles and other objects to send and receive data through the internet using sensors. These objects could be a TV, speaker, coffeemaker, refrigerator, air conditioner, and anything else that could be powered. The architectural components of these IoT devices involves Radio-Frequency Identification(RFID) items which is a tool used for data communication (Weber, 2010). An example of an IoT device could be turning on a light switch from your smartphone or even a car driving itself. You can have your refrigerator detect the expired foods and place an order to the grocery store on its own. The internet of things are these objects that used to depend on humans to operate can now operate on their own by connecting to the internet. A report analyzed that 8.4 billion IoT devices worldwide were used in 2017 and it is predicted to go up in 2020 to 20.4 billion. The movement has predicted to one day make almost everything connect to the internet.</p>
            <p>The internet of things is making a significant impact on society that can be both beneficial and detrimental to society in many ways. The IoT has many benefits for you, your home, an enterprise, utilities and mobiles. These benefits include smarter analytics, enhanced security, increased productivity, smart inventory, safer travel and real time demand visibility. IoT devices can provide benefits in the areas of transportation, agriculture, healthcare, entertainment, fitness and more. In cases where a doctor may need to monitor a patient from home, these sensors can be used where the doctor may check-in on the patient and the patient is able to save money on hospital expenses. Devices in homes may also be monitored and controlled to reduce the amount of energy being used. This would be very beneficial to the society as it can make a huge impact on the conservation of energy if all homes were to have this. Big businesses can also use sensors to monitor their employees' activities. Sensors have been widely used in factory settings. They are very useful for things like climate control, security, automation, etc. IoT will allow for a much more efficient wireless setup which can allow the owner to manage and change the system when needed. (Chandrakanth, Venkatesh, Mahesh, & Naganjaneyulu, 2014). Surveillance systems have become more advanced due to the IoT with image processing and networking frameworks. Because of the popularity of such systems, this benefits many home and business owners. Another advancement is the ability to monitor water using sensors that can be used to check the quality of water, avoid contaminated water and benefit the irrigation systems. The internet of things may also have an impact on the growth of the economy. The economy will be effected by the introduction of many new services and devices.</p>
            <p>The proposal of a "smart city" concept may also benefit those who live in cities. This can be fulfilled with the arrangement of an urban IoT. This is a foundation of communication which will allow for easy, consolidated, and efficient contact with an excess of public services. This will expose the citizens to more harmonized and transparent information. This IoT will be beneficial to public services by gaining control, management and growth. These services include lighting, parking, surveillance, transportation, maintenance, garbage collection, school, hospitals, etc. Additionally, this will make more data available to the public that will help the opinions of citizens toward the local government due to the transparency of the data. It will also make the citizens more aware of the conditions in their city and promote the involvement of citizens in public administration. The invention of new services to cities may also be an outcome of this change (Zanella, Bui, Castellani, Vangelista, & Zorzi, 2014). This means that the health of buildings, waste management, air quality, noise, traffic, energy consumption and other city-related issues will be able to be monitored. This can make a major positive impact on many cities. </p>
            <p>On the other hand, despite all the advancements and benefits to our society, it may also be very detrimental to society. It poses the question of whether security and privacy issues outweigh the benefits. These systems and devices that will be used within our homes and businesses collect a lot of data about you. An IoT device can potentially have information stored about a person's location, health, finances, shopping behavior and inventory (Singh & Singh, 2015). In an instance where an employer is monitoring their employees, they may feel that this is a violation of their privacy. In other situations, these systems and sensors may make it easier for others to get a hold of your information putting yourself at risk. Once a person has targeted you, they may hack into your phone, TV, speaker or even refrigerator to gather your information and follow your every step without you even knowing it. There is also a device that can be used to control your garage door from your smartphone. Someone can potentially break into the device and use it to enter peoples' homes. Another system may be installed into your house to control the lights, music and other devices from a touch screen device installed onto the wall. It has been discovered that someone may gain access of the device's microphone and use it to record conversations nearby. Other issues with the IoT is its effect on insurance. How will the insurance industry be affected based on self-driving cars? Another concern is the technical aspects because these IoT devices and the network must be able to collect and protect a large amount of data. The IoT devices also presents the concerns of how to handle social and legal situations when a device does not work properly. In the event that a self-driving car or other autonomous device runs out of control, how will the legal system handle it? Another factor is the cost of some of these IoT devices. They are not cheap and adding additional security to them is an added price tag. In a smart house, cyber-security is crucial for protection from intruders and this comes at a very high price.</p>

            <p><em><strong>IoT is transforming the everyday physical objects that surround us into and ecosystem of information that will enrich our lives. From refrigerators to parking spaces to houses, the IoT is bringing more and more things into the digital fold every day, which will likely make the IoT a multi-trillion dollar industry in the near future. ~PricewaterhouseCoopers</strong></em></p>
